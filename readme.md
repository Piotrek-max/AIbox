# AIbox 📦

AIbox is a laboratory for exploring, testing, and visualizing various AI and machine learning methods.  
It combines ideas from statistical learning, computer vision, and mathematical modeling — created purely for curiosity, research, and fun.

## Goals
- Experiment with classical and modern ML/AI techniques  
- Build reusable tools for analysis, visualization, and data processing  
- Connect mathematical concepts with real AI applications  
- Learn and document progress through interactive notebooks  

## Current Problems
- **Regression**: Implementing and comparing linear regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression on synthetic and real datasets.
- **Classification**: Exploring logistic regression, support vector machines, and decision trees for binary and multi-class classification tasks.
- **SVM**: Implementing support vector machines with different kernels and visualizing decision boundaries.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Experimenting with teacher-student models to transfer knowledge from a larger model to a smaller one.
- **Pipelines**: Building end-to-end machine learning pipelines for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Boosting**: Implementing boosting algorithms like Gradient Boosting for improving model performance.
