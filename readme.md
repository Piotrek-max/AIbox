# AIbox 📦

AIbox is a laboratory for exploring, testing, and visualizing various AI and machine learning methods.  
Main goal is to create a sandbox environment for experiments with different algorithms.
Repository might be also helpful for new learners with their journey into AI/ML.
Project combines ideas from statistical learning, mathematical modeling and deep learning.

## Current Problems
- **Regression**: Implementing and comparing linear regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression on synthetic and real datasets.
- **Classification**: Exploring logistic regression, support vector machines, and decision trees for binary and multi-class classification tasks.
- **SVM**: Implementing support vector machines with different kernels and visualizing decision boundaries.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Experimenting with teacher-student models to transfer knowledge from a larger model to a smaller one.
- **Pipelines**: Building end-to-end machine learning pipelines for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Boosting**: Implementing boosting algorithms like Gradient Boosting for improving model performance.

## Usage
To setup the environment, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
```shell
uv sync
```
3. Experiment with different notebooks
